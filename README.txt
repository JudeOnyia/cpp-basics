Created a class to perform pseudo random number generation (linear congruential generator). The generated integer
sequence is xn = mod(axn−1 +c,m). Where a, c, and m are integers such that m > 0, 0 < a < m, and 0 ≤ c < m.
x0 (where 0 ≤ x0 < m) is known as the seed and corresponds to the initial state of the LCG. The class contains
several useful member functions.

Created a class to perform rational number arithmetic. A rational number is a number of the form x/y, where x and y
are integers and y 6= 0 (i.e., a rational number is a ratio of integers). Rational numbers are sometimes useful for
representing real numbers in contexts where the roundoff error associated with floating-point arithmetic would
be problematic.
